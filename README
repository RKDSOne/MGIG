MGIG is an efficient higher order feature selection algorithm for text classification.  
The original codes are writen in "R" language and used with Rapidminer. 
This repository aims to help users who want to implement their own code of MGIG algroithm.
For details of MGIG algorithm, please see the following paper:
Feature selection via maximizing global information gain for text classification

Functions of files:

getdata.R:  this file is used to construct corpus into a matrix and divide the whole documents into n folds.

fs.R: selecte features from training set.

transforms.R: this file is used to construct testing sets. I use Rapidminer to conduct experiments, 
because rapidminer cannot  use string labels, transforms.R converts labels into number.

please compile overallentropy.cc  and  rinterface.c using makefile, they will be called in fs.R.  
Noting: overallentropy.cc uses the log function in fmath.hpp, which can be found at https://github.com/herumi/fmath
You should download fmath.hpp and save it in the directory.

The mgig algorithm is mainly implemented in fs.R file.
